# Unit 5 - Introduction to Functions /problems/

## Problem 1
Create a program that reads an integer from the console and check whether it is symmetrical.
Use a function to perform the check

## Problem 2
Create a function that prints the largest of 3 given integers

## Problem 3
Create a function that calculates the mathematical function
````
sign(a) = 
    -1, if a < 0
    0 , if a == 0
    1 , if a > 0
````
Using this function, create a program that calculates and prints
(sign(x)+sign(y))*sign(x+y)
## Problem 4
Create a program that reads 2 integers `n ` and `m` from the console and
calculates and prints `n^m`.
Use a function you defined to perform the calculation

## Problem 5
Create a program that prints all primes in the range `[1;n]`,
where `n` is input from the console. Use 2 functions - one to check whether
a number is prime, and 1 to perform the printing.

## Problem 6
Create a program that reads 2 integers - `k` and `l` from the console input
and prints all integers in the range `[k;l]` that have 2 identical neighbour digits
in decimal notation. Use 2 functions - one to print the integers in that range and one
to perform the check whether a number satisfies the forementioned condition
````
Example input:
60 120

Example output:
66 77 88 99 100 110 111 112 113 114 115 116 117 118 119
````

## Problem 7
Create a program that reads 3 integers - `m`, `n` and `k` from the console input
and prints all integers in the range `[m;n]` which satisfy the condition that
the average of their digits is >=`k`
````
Example input:
10 50 6

Example output:
39 48 49
````

## Problem 8
Create a function that calculates the sum of all integers in the range `[a;b]`.
Use this function to calculate the expression:
````
(1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 153) / (m + (m + 1) + ... + n)
````

## Problem 9
Create a function that, by given day, month and year finds the next date.
Use this function to find the date `n` days after a given date.

## Problem 10
Create a function that, by given the float coordinates of 2 points, checks whether
they are on a line parallel to the X or Y axis. Using that function,
create a program that reads the coordinates of pairs of points and prints
whether they satisfy this condition or not until the numbers `0 0 0 0` are entered.
