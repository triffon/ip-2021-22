## Problems
- Write a program that reads a number N from STDIN (N between 1 and 1000000) and writes on STDOUT N with all digits reversed (e.g. 12345 -> 54321).
- Write a program that reads a number N and a character C from STDIN (N between 1 and 20) and writes on STDOUT an ASCII square with side N filled with C.
- Write a program that reads numbers N and X from STDIN (N, X between 1 and 20) and writes on STDOUT the sum of the series [x - x^3 + x^5 - ... Â± x^N].
- Write a program that reads a number N from STDIN (N between 1 and 100) and writes on STDOUT all possible ways to express N as a sum of two prime numbers (e.g. 20 -> 3 + 17 & 7 + 13).
- Write a program that reads a number N and a character C from STDIN (N between 1 and 20) and writes on STDOUT N lines of C repeated N times.

## Problems for the Pros
- Implement a programm that is capable of compressing/decompressing text files using [Huffman Coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding). The program is expected to work as follows (see: [Command Line Arguments in C/C++](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/command-line-arguments-in-c-cpp/)):
    - Compression - _**<path_to_executable> -c -f <path_to_text_file> -o <path_to_compressed_file>**_
    - Decompression - _**<path_to_executable> -d -f <path_to_compressed_file> -o <path_to_text_file>**_

## Solutions
Upload solutions in your GitHub folder (see: [how-to](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/saving-changes/git-commit)) (only .CPP files, no executable files)
