# Assignment

## Prerequisites
- [Install C++ Compiler](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/cpp#_install-a-compiler)
- [Install VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- [Install VSCode C++ Extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/cpp#_install-the-extension)

## Recap from Lectures
- [Types of Programming Languages](https://www.watelectronics.com/types-of-programming-languages-with-differences/)
- [Numeral Systems in Computer Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_number_format)

## Problems
- Write a program that prints ‘Hello World’ to the screen (see: [example](https://github.com/triffon/ip-2021-22/blob/master/exercises/7/Week-1/Examples/HelloWorldExample.cpp)). 
- Write a program that prints all prime numbers between 1 and 1 000 000 (see: [example](https://github.com/triffon/ip-2021-22/blob/master/exercises/7/Week-1/Examples/PrimeNumbersExample.cpp)).
- Write a program that prints a multiplication table for numbers up to 12 (see: [example](https://github.com/triffon/ip-2021-22/blob/master/exercises/7/Week-1/Examples/MultiplicationTableExample.cpp)).
- Write a program that asks the user for a number n and prints the sum of the numbers 1 to n (see: [example](https://github.com/triffon/ip-2021-22/blob/master/exercises/7/Week-1/Examples/SumNumbersExample.cpp)).
- Write a program that asks the user for their name and greets them with their name only if they're named Alice or Bob (see: [example](https://github.com/triffon/ip-2021-22/blob/master/exercises/7/Week-1/Examples/GreetingsExample.cpp)).
- Write a program that asks the user for a number n and gives them the possibility to choose between computing the sum and computing the product of 1,…,n (see: [example](https://github.com/triffon/ip-2021-22/blob/master/exercises/7/Week-1/Examples/SumOrProductExample.cpp)).
- Write a guessing game where the user has to guess a secret number. After every guess the program tells the user whether their number was too large or too small. At the end the number of tries needed should be printed. It counts only as one try if they input the same number multiple times consecutively (see: [example](https://github.com/triffon/ip-2021-22/blob/master/exercises/7/Week-1/Examples/GuessingGameExample.cpp)).
