## Problems
- Write a program that reads a number N from STDIN (N between 1 and 1000000) and writes on STDOUT all "perfect" numbers between 1 and N incl. A number is considered perfect if it is equal to the sum of its divisors - e.g. 6 = 1 + 2 + 3 (see: [example](https://github.com/triffon/ip-2021-22/blob/master/exercises/7/Week-4/Examples/AllPerfectNumbersExample.cpp)).
- Write a program that reads two numbers A and B from STDIN (A,B between 1 and 1000000) and writes on STDOUT the greatest common divisor of A and B calculated using the [Euclid's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor#Euclid's_algorithm) (see: [example](https://github.com/triffon/ip-2021-22/blob/master/exercises/7/Week-4/Examples/EudlicGCDExample.cpp)).
- Write a program that reads the coordinates of two chess board squares (X and Y) from STDIN and writes on STDOUT whether a pawn, a rook or a bishop can go from X to Y (see: [example](https://github.com/triffon/ip-2021-22/blob/master/exercises/7/Week-4/Examples/ChessBoardExample.cpp)).
- Write a program that reads a YEAR (YEAR between 1900 and 9999), MONTH (MONTH between 1 and 12) and a DAY (DAY between 1 and 31) from STDIN and writes on STDOUT whether they form a valid date (see: [example](https://github.com/triffon/ip-2021-22/blob/master/exercises/7/Week-4/Examples/DateValidatorExample.cpp)).
- Write a program that reads a MONTH (MONTH between 1 and 12) from STDIN and writes on STDOUT the season that this month is part of (see: [example](https://github.com/triffon/ip-2021-22/blob/master/exercises/7/Week-4/Examples/SeasonsExample.cpp)).
