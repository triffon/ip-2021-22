## Problems
- Write a program that reads a number N from STDIN (N between 5 and 50) and then subsequently reads N numbers from STDIN. At the end of the program write on STDOUT whether the numbers form a symmetrical sequence - sequence is the same when read left to right or right to left (see: [example](https://github.com/triffon/ip-2021-22/blob/master/exercises/7/Week-6/Examples/SymmertricalSequenceExample.cpp)).
- Write a program that reads a number N from STDIN (N between 5 and 50) and then subsequently reads two vectors consisting of N numbers each from STDIN. At the end of the program write on STDOUT [the entrywise product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadamard_product_(matrices)) of the two vectors (see: [example](https://github.com/triffon/ip-2021-22/blob/master/exercises/7/Week-6/Examples/EntrywiseProductExample.cpp)).
- Write a program that reads two numbers N & K from STDIN (N between 5 and 50, K between 4 and N) and then subsequently reads two sequences - first consisting of N numbers, second consisting of K numbers from STDIN. At the end of the program write on STDOUT the number of times that the second sequence appears in the first one (see: [example](https://github.com/triffon/ip-2021-22/blob/master/exercises/7/Week-6/Examples/ContainsSequenceExample.cpp)).
- Write a program that reads a number N STDIN (N between 5 and 50) and then subsequently reads N numbers from STDIN. At the end of the program write on STDOUT the unique numbers amongst the once read from STDIN (see: [example](https://github.com/triffon/ip-2021-22/blob/master/exercises/7/Week-6/Examples/UniqueElementsExample.cpp)).
- Write a program that reads a number N STDIN (N between 5 and 50) and then subsequently reads N numbers from STDIN. At the end of the program write on STDOUT the number of times each element is found in the sequence (see: [example](https://github.com/triffon/ip-2021-22/blob/master/exercises/7/Week-6/Examples/NumberOfOccurrencesExample.cpp.cpp)).
