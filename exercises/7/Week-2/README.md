## Problems
- Write a program that reads two numbers N & M from STDIN (N & M between 0 and 1 000 000) and swaps their values:
	- with a third variable O
	- without a third variable

- Write a program that reads a number N from STDIN (N between 0 and 3 000) and writes on STDOUT whether N is a leap year.

- Write a program that reads a number N from STDIN (N between 0 and 1 000 000) and writes on STDOUT the number of trailing zeros at the end of N factorial (e.g. 5! is 120, so it has one trailing zero).

- Write a program that reads a temperature T from STDIN (T between -500 and 500) and a character S (can be one of [c, f, C, F]) and writes on STDOUT:
	- if S == 'c' || S == 'C': the temperature in Fahrenheit converted using the formula  ((T * 9) / 5) + 32
	- if S == 'f' || S == 'F': the temperature in Celsius converted using the formula  ((T - 32) * 5) / 9

- Write a program that reads a number N from STDIN (N between 0 and 1 000 000) and writes on STDOUT:
	- N in binary
	- N in octal
	- N in decimal
	- N in hexademical 

- Write a program that reads a number N from STDIN (N between 0 and 100) and writes on STDOUT:
	- the Nth number in the Fibonacci sequence (using a for-loop)
	- the Nth number in the Fibonacci sequence (using a reqursive function)*
