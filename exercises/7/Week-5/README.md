## Problems
- Write a program that reads a number N from STDIN (N between 1 and 50) and writes on STDOUT the sum of all Fibonacci numbers beteen 0 and N.
- Write a program that reads a number N from STDIN (N between 5 and 100) and then subsequently reads N numbers from STDIN. At the end of the program write on STDOUT the numbers in sorted order (smallest number first).
- Write a program that reads a number N from STDIN (N between 5 and 100) and then subsequently reads N numbers from STDIN. At the end of the program write on STDOUT whether the numbers include 5, 10 or 50 by applying [Binary Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm).
- Write a program that reads a number N from STDIN (N between 5 and 100) and then subsequently reads N numbers from STDIN. At the end of the program write on STDOUT the longest subsequence of the original for which it is true that for i < j -> a[i] < a[j].
