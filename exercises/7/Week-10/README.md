## Problems

- Write a program that reads a number N from STDIN (1 < N < 11) and subsequently reads from STDIN the numbers comprising a NxN matrix A. At the end of the program write on STDOUT the product of all even numbers that are greater than 0 and are above the [main diagonal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_diagonal) of A (see: [example](https://github.com/triffon/ip-2021-22/blob/master/exercises/7/Week-10/Examples/MatrixElementsProductExample.cpp)).
- Write a program that reads a number N from STDIN (1 < N < 11) and subsequently reads from STDIN the numbers comprising a NxN matrix A. At the end of the program write on STDOUT the position of the first non-negative element that is on the [main diagonal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_diagonal) of A (see: [example](https://github.com/triffon/ip-2021-22/blob/master/exercises/7/Week-10/Examples/FirstPositiveElementExample.cpp)).
- Write a program that reads a number N from STDIN (1 < N < 11) and subsequently reads from STDIN the numbers comprising a NxN matrix A. At the end of the program write on STDOUT A after 'rotating' its elements arount the [main diagonal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_diagonal) of A (see: [example](https://github.com/triffon/ip-2021-22/blob/master/exercises/7/Week-10/Examples/RotateMatrixExample.cpp)).
- Write a program that reads a string S from STDIN (0 < streln(S) < 128). At the end of the program write on STDOUT the words in S on (each word on a new line) and subsequently the words in S sorted in lexicographical order (each word on a new line) (see: [example](https://github.com/triffon/ip-2021-22/blob/master/exercises/7/Week-10/Examples/SortWordsExample.cpp)).
